I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Seville and a member of the <a href="https://personal.us.es/cborra/the-project/" target="_blank">Family Wellbeing and Child Welfare Research Group</a>.
My research centers on applied microeconomics, with a particular emphasis on family, health, and education economics.
